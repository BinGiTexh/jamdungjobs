---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Integration

### 1. Component Files
All components are located in `/web-frontend/src/components/common/`:
- `JobShareButton.js`
- `RecentlyViewedJobs.js`
- `DeadlineWarning.js`

### 2. Dependencies
The components use existing project dependencies:
- **React** (hooks: useState, useEffect)
- **Material-UI** (for demo page styling)
- **React Icons** (for social media and UI icons)
- **React Router** (for navigation)

### 3. Integration Steps

#### Add to existing job cards:
```jsx
// Import components
import JobShareButton from './common/JobShareButton';
import DeadlineWarning from './common/DeadlineWarning';
import { trackJobView } from './common/RecentlyViewedJobs';

// In your job card component
<div className="job-card">
  {/* Existing job content */}
  
  {/* Add deadline warning */}
  <DeadlineWarning job={job} />
  
  {/* Add share button */}
  <JobShareButton job={job} />
  
  {/* Track when job is viewed */}
  <button onClick={() => {
    trackJobView(job);
    // Handle job viewing logic
  }}>
    View Job
  </button>
</div>
```

#### Add recently viewed sidebar:
```jsx
// Import component
import RecentlyViewedJobs from './common/RecentlyViewedJobs';

// In your layout/sidebar
<aside className="sidebar">
  <RecentlyViewedJobs limit={5} />
</aside>
```
