Benefits of This Approach

Single Codebase: You manage one codebase instead of separate mobile and desktop versions
Cost-Effective: Hosting one website is cheaper than multiple versions
SEO-Friendly: Search engines prefer responsive sites over separate mobile sites
Easier Maintenance: Changes automatically apply to all device sizes

Deployment Cost Optimization
Since the same code serves all devices, you can optimize AWS costs by:

Efficient Caching: Set long cache times for static assets with CloudFront
Image Optimization: Serve different image sizes based on device with srcset
Code Splitting: Only load the JavaScript needed for the current view
